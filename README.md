# The problem
We have a little problem which is Task management.
So our company decided to build a simple todo so our co-workers can track what their are doing
with the following design 

![alt text](todo-app.png)
 
## Functional requirements
- add todo
- mark todo as done or undone
- clear all todos marked as done

## Non functional requirements
- use the provided design
- to add todo users must use the input provided by the design and press enter
- to mark as done or undone users must click at the circle at the left corner of the todo
- all done todos should appear at the end of the list 
- it should be responsive so we can use on our smart phones
- use your creativity ;)


## Extra points
- Follow development best practices in vuejs development
- Do not use JQuery or any other libraries that are not necessary
- Use reusable components
- Document your code with comments
- Provide a better Design for the app
- Use Sass
